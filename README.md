# THE FLOOR IS LAVA
## What? 
This game is the product of the collaborative work that has been done at the **Global Game Jam 2019**
### WHAT HOME MEANS TO YOU
Along with this topic we decided to rebuild the childhood game **The Floor is Lava**.
Also we decided to give this game the classical _one machine, two players_ look and feel.
You are able to play the game with 2 controllers on one machine.
